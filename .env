# Setting up Bitwarden for the first time can be done in two ways:
# Uncomment the method you want to use / comment the one you don't
# Method 1. This is my preferred method because it avoids publicly enabling signup.
#           First generate an ADMIN_TOKEN using gthe command `openssl rand -base64 48`
#           After creating user(s), it's a good idea to disable the admin page entirely
#           by clearing the ADMIN_TOKEN variable; editing settings on the admin page
#           overrides these variables and can be cause confusion later on.
SIGNUPS_ALLOWED=false
ADMIN_TOKEN=
# Method 2. Disable signups entirely and create all accounts using the admin page.
#           Set up your primary account with SIGNUPS_ALLOWED=true, then set it to false once
#           you have created any accounts. 
#           Create an organization and send invites to users you want to join your org.
#           An empty ADMIN_TOKEN disables access to the admin page entirely.
#SIGNUPS_ALLOWED=true
#ADMIN_TOKEN=
