# Setting up Bitwarden for the first time can be done in two ways:
# Uncomment the method you want to use / comment the one you don't
# Method 1. [RECOMMENDED] because it avoids the admin page entirely; using the admin
#           page overrides these environmental variables which can cause confusion.
#           1. Set up your primary account(s) while SIGNUPS_ALLOWED=true
#           2. Set SIGNUPS_ALLOWED=false
#           3. Set the SMTP details above to enable e-mail invitation
#           4. Invite other users from within Bitwarden
#           Keep ADMIN_TOKEN blank to disable access to the admin page entirely.
SIGNUPS_ALLOWED=true
ADMIN_TOKEN=
# Method 2. Use the admin page to create your first user(s) then disable it.
#           1. Set ADMIN_TOKEN using gthe command `openssl rand -base64 48`
#           2. Use the admin page (/admin) to create your initial user(s).
